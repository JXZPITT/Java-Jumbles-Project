# Java-Jumbles-Project

The source code file is Jumbles.java.  
There are some overflow problems and some arrays that need to be upsized.  

My email address is JIZ176@pitt.edu.  

I wish I could explain some points in my source code, but I have little time this week. So if you are interested in it, please sent me email, and I will explain those to you.
